    "question_text": "Based on Torricelli's Law and the information in the diagram, if the depth 'h' of the hole below the surface were to increase, how would the efflux velocity 'v2' change, assuming all other factors remain constant?",

    "difficulty_level": "Hard",
    "explanation": "The efflux velocity is v2 = sqrt(2gh). The time it takes for the water to fall a height y2 is t = sqrt(2y2/g). The horizontal range x is v2*t = sqrt(2gh) * sqrt(2y2/g) = 2*sqrt(h*y2). Since h = y1 - y2, we have x = 2*sqrt((y1 - y2)y2). To maximize x, we need to maximize the term (y1 - y2)y2. Let f(y2) = y1*y2 - y2^2. Taking the derivative with respect to y2 and setting it to zero: df/dy2 = y1 - 2y2 = 0, which implies y2 = y1/2. If y2 = y1/2, then h = y1 - y2 = y1 - y1/2 = y1/2. Thus, the maximum horizontal range occurs when the hole is at half the total liquid depth."
