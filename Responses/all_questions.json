    "explanation": "The displacement in simple harmonic motion can be described as x(t) = A cos(ωt). The potential energy is U(t) = 1/2 k x(t)^2 = 1/2 k A^2 cos^2(ωt). Using the trigonometric identity cos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2, we get U(t) = (1/4) k A^2 (1 + cos(2ωt)). Similarly, kinetic energy K(t) = 1/2 m v(t)^2 = 1/2 m (-Aω sin(ωt))^2 = 1/2 m A^2 ω^2 sin^2(ωt). Using sin^2(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2 and mω^2 = k, we get K(t) = (1/4) k A^2 (1 - cos(2ωt)). Both K(t) and U(t) therefore oscillate at twice the angular frequency (2ω) of the displacement. Graph (a) visually confirms this by showing two complete cycles of K(t) and U(t) over one full period T of the underlying displacement.",

    "explanation": "We use the combined gas law: (P1V1)/T1 = (P2V2)/T2.

P2 = 1 atm, T2 = 300.15 K.\nSolving for V2: V2 = V1 * (P1/P2) * (T2/T1) = V * (3 atm / 1 atm) * (300.15 K / 266.15 K) = V * 3 * 1.12788... ≈ 3.38 V.

    "explanation": "From the combined gas law calculation (as in the medium difficulty question), we found that the volume of the bubble at the top (V2) is approximately 3.38 times its volume at the bottom (V1). That is, V2 ≈ 3.38 * V1. For a spherical bubble, volume V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius. Since diameter D = 2r, V is proportional to D³. Therefore, the ratio of the diameters is (D2/D1) = (V2/V1)^(1/3). \nSubstituting the volume ratio: D2/D1 ≈ (3.38)^(1/3). \nThe cube root of 3.38 is approximately 1.50. So, D2 ≈ 1.5 * D1. If the initial diameter is 'd', the final diameter is approximately 1.5 d.",
