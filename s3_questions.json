    "explanation": "The image shows a string of length L resonating in the 3rd harmonic, indicated by `L = 3λ₃/2`. This follows the general condition for standing waves on a string fixed at both ends (or a configuration that effectively behaves as such for wavelength calculation), which is `L = nλ/2`, where `n` is the harmonic number. Thus, for the initial state, `n = 3`, and `λ₃ = 2L/3`.\n\nThe wave speed (v) on a string is given by `v = fλ`, where `f` is the frequency and `λ` is the wavelength. The wave speed is also determined by the tension (T) and the linear mass density (μ) of the string: `v = √(T/μ)`. The tension T is provided by the hanging mass `m`, so `T = mg`.\n\nCombining these relationships:\n`fλ = √(mg/μ)`\nSubstituting `λ = 2L/n`:\n`f(2L/n) = √(mg/μ)`\n\nTo find the relationship between mass and harmonic number, we can square both sides and rearrange for `m`:\n`f²(4L²/n²) = mg/μ`\n`m = (f² * 4L² * μ) / (g * n²)`\n\nSince the vibrator's frequency (`f`), string length (`L`), linear mass density (`μ`), and acceleration due to gravity (`g`) are all constant, the mass `m` is inversely proportional to the square of the harmonic number (`n²`):\n`m ∝ 1/n²`\n\nFor the initial state (3rd harmonic, `n₃ = 3`), the mass is `m₃`.\nFor the desired state (5th harmonic, `n₅ = 5`), the mass is `m₅`.\n\nTherefore, we can write the ratio:\n`m₅ / m₃ = (1/n₅²) / (1/n₃²) = n₃² / n₅²`\n`m₅ / m₃ = 3² / 5² = 9 / 25`\n`m₅ = (9/25)m₃`\n\nThus, the mass must be decreased to (9/25) of its original value to achieve resonance in the 5th harmonic at the same frequency.",

According to Hooke's Law, this elastic potential energy (U_s) is given by U_s = 1/2 kx^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement. Since the system moves from x=0 (equilibrium) to x=x1 (compressed state), x is non-zero, meaning the elastic potential energy increases from zero to 1/2 kx1^2. Concurrently, the spring exerts a restoring force, F = -kx, which is always directed opposite to the displacement from equilibrium.

Consequently, ΔU becomes negative, meaning the internal energy of the gas decreases. A decrease in internal energy directly corresponds to a decrease in temperature (Tf < Ti).\n\nDuring compression, work is done on the gas by the surroundings (W < 0). This makes ΔU positive, indicating an increase in the internal energy of the gas.
