3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_exam_app.py
   ```

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t physics-exam .
   ```

2. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 physics-exam
   ```

3. **Access the app** at http://localhost:8501

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: AWS region (default: us-west-2)
